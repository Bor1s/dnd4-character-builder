#NOTE most feats will not have any rule, because they provides only txt info
#used on character sheet. But for other feats I have to create some custom rules.

FactoryGirl.define do
  #factory :action_surge_availablity_rule, parent: :rule do
    #name :action_surge_availablity_rule
    #todo Hash[
      #what: "{grant_access_to_action_surge_feat}",
      #if: "{human?}"
    #]
    #root true
  #end
end
